      <description>Technical debt is defined as “…the implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an ill-suited solution —could be easy, limited or over-engineered— now as opposed to using an appropriate solution.” [1]
It is the effort that builds up when a team makes a conscious decision to implement code that’s regarded as a quick fix, instead of building out the best solution. The quick fix is the “debt” and like any kind of debt, it accrues interest over time, so the additional effort built up which could be time, money or resources is the tech debt that builds up and makes it harder to easily implement a better solution.</description>
